Hi, welcome to the repo for the code I produced during my MMath project. This is code I produced "from scratch" to demonstrate the FEM and its applications to the Helmholtz equation. To avoid complicated book keeping, this is limited to 1D. As for higher dimensions, I used [oomph-lib](https://github.com/oomph-lib/oomph-lib)

See [Report](Report.pdf) for more details on project.

Please see [the FEM namespace](FiniteElementMethod.h) for the correct order of operations.

Please see [this example](example.cpp) for an example of using the code.

Cheers :)
